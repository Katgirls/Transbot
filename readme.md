# Transbot

Transbot is a Minecraft bot created using the Mineflayer library for Node.js. Transbot was created with the intent of being a chatbot / assistance bot

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js installed. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the Transbot repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/FelixCharm/Transbot.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```
cd transbot
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the Transbot, run the following command from the project directory:

```
node main.js
```

By default, the bot will attempt to connect to a Minecraft server running on `play.fennet.rentals` on port `25565`. You can change this by editing the `main.js` file.
